Task 1:Spam SMS Detection using NaiveBayes Algorithm

Naive Bayes is a simple yet effective algorithm for detecting spam SMS. It works by calculating the probability that a given message is spam based on the words it contains. The algorithm uses prior knowledge from a training dataset of labeled messages (spam or ham) to classify new messages.
